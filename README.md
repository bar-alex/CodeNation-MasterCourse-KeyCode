# CodeNation-MasterCourse-KeyCode
Web page that reads a keyboard key and displays information about it

The project is live at https://magical-bavarois-9ece48.netlify.app/

Here's some of the stuff I got working in this project: 

* Frosty glass effect and nice text shadows
* cycling backgrounds every 10 seconds with an easing transition
* Catches and displays information about the keypress (keydown) event
* Displays the modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt)
